## Loading and preprocessing the data

### Download file and load to R

First we use the download.file() function to download the raw data file, then use read.table and unz
() to load it to R.

```{r echo=TRUE}

download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", "activity data.zip")

data <- read.table(unz("activity data.zip", "activity.csv"), header=T, sep=",")


```

### Review the data

Now we take a look at the data set to ensure it is consistent with our expectations.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
